// Revisit the main lab and solve every problem using only the reduce method. 
// Don't worry about all the tests that tell you that you must use
// such and such method. Using reduce will still allow you to pass all the tests. 

// You can write your own Array methods! 

// ```js
// Array.prototype.sayHi = function() {
//   return "Hi"
// }
// ```
// Now every array that you write has a `sayHi` method that you can call.

// ```js
// let myArr = [1,2,3]
// myArr.sayHi() //returns "Hi" 
// ```

// A couple of things to be aware of: 
// 1. You must write the anonymous function is ES5 syntax. 
// 2. To refer to the array that the method is being called on use the keyword `this`
//      This means that `this[0]` evaluates to the first element of the array
// 3. You can pass anything as an argument to a method (including another function often called a callback)
